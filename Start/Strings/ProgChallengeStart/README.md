<<<<<<< HEAD
### This is a very simple app aimed for the beginners who want to get up to speed with a small app. This program will generate a random number in the background between 1 and 20. The user will need to guess which number the computer has stored. If your guess is higher than the number then it will show a message on the screen it will do the same if the number is lower. The app will also keep track of how many times you guessed and it will reset when the new number is generated again.
