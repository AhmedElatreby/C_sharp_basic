## Palindrome challenge

### Rules of our challenge for the palindrome detection are going to be as follows.
1- The program reads the input and determines if the string is a palindrome.
2- The program has to ignore case and punctuation and also white space. 
3- Strip the white space out as well. 
4- The function must be named "IsPalindrome" and it will return two values. 
5- To return a Boolean indicating whether the string is a palindrome, and an integer that will be the length of the string if it is a palindrome or zero, or not. 
6- The program runs until the word "exit" is typed in.
